Code for my bachelor thesis on energy-potential based physics-informed neural networks for heterogeneous materials.
SEM/ includes implementations of the deep-energy-method (DEM) with improved accuracy by random-fourier-feature (RFF) mapping as well as the shallow-energy-method (SEM) which uses a radial-basis-function neural network (RBFNN).
SEM_Faster/ includes an alternate implementation of the SEM with much faster GPU computation time but also higher memory usage.
FEM/ includes code for a finite-element reference solution.
